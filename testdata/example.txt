I am seated in an office, surrounded by heads and bodies. My posture is consciously congruent to the shape of my hard chair.
This is a cold room in University Administration, wood-walled, Remington-hung, double-windowed against the November heat,
insulated from Administrative sounds by the reception area outside, at which Uncle Charles, Mr. deLint and I were lately received.
I am in here.
Three faces have resolved into place above summer-weight sportcoats and half-Windsors across a polished pine conference
table shiny with the spidered light of an Arizona noon. These are three Deans â€” of Admissions, Academic Affairs, Athletic
Affairs. I do not know which face belongs to whom.
I believe I appear neutral, maybe even pleasant, though I've been coached to err on the side of neutrality and not attempt what
would feel to me like a pleasant expression or smile.
I have committed to crossing my legs I hope carefully, ankle on knee, hands together in the lap of my slacks. My fingers are
mated into a mirrored series of what manifests, to me, as the letter X. The interview room's other personnel include: the
University's Director of Composition, its varsity tennis coach, and Academy prorector Mr. A. deLint. C.T. is beside me; the others
sit, stand and stand, respectively, at the periphery of my focus. The tennis coach jingles pocket-change. There is something
vaguely digestive about the room's odor. The high-traction sole of my complimentary Nike sneaker runs parallel to the wobbling
loafer of my mother's half-brother, here in his capacity as Headmaster, sitting in the chair to what I hope is my immediate right,
also facing Deans.
